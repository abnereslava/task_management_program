# task_management_program
A simple task management program, consisting of a menu from which you can organize and view your tasks. 

It was my hardest code til the moment: it took me 3 days to finish it. 

I'm still a beginner in coding (I'm on it for almost two weeks now), so I made it in order to learn more about Python lists. 

It could use some improvement in the future, but it is running, and that's what matters for now...
